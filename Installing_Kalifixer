KaliFixer is a bash script created to help newbies in Kali Linux. We have all been there that dreaded moment
when we try to update Kali Linux using apt-get only to be presented with update errors. Donâ€™t worry KaliFixer is on hand !.

This script will first find the version of Kali using kernel headers of your Kali install once the version of Kali Linux
is found it will update sources.list with the correct repositories for Kali to function correctly. Enjoy if this script 
was useful to use consider sharing it with friends & on social media.
